# SuperPointSuperGlue_CameraRelocation

This repo contains additional scripts to run with https://github.com/magicleap/SuperGluePretrainedNetwork. Simply copy these files into your SuperGluePretrainedNetwork fork, change the directories in the scripts, and run the scripts.

It adds data preprocessing, coordinates pre-alignment, camera intrinsic(github.com/zinsmatt/7-Scenes-Calibration), and evaluation steps.
